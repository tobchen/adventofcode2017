Solutions for Advent of Code 2017

The source codes in this repository are not art, they're not examples of good
coding conventions. The scripts or programs were rarely more than hastily
written tools to quickly get to a solution. They do not present my clean coding
skills, they're not supposed to.

With that said: You have to admit day five's codes are pretty cool.
